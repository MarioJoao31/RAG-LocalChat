A high amount of \\nplant-based food consumption, at least 400\\xa0g of fruits and vegetables is recom-\\nmended in dietary guidelines (Agudo 2005). Epidemiological surveys indicated a \\npositive correlation towards a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and minimized the \\noccurrence of degenerative diseases including certain types of cancer, cardiovascu-\\nlar diseases, macular degeneration, aging and others (Michels et\\xa0 al. 2000; \\nTrichopoulou et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2003; Willcox et\\xa0al. 2003; Dauchet et\\xa0al. 2006; Ordovas et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2007; Liu 2013). Fruits and vegetables contain a wide range of micronutrients and non-nutrient \\nbioactive compounds such as dietary fiber, minerals (potassium, calcium, and mag-\\nnesium) vitamins (A, C and E), phytochemicals (poly phenolic compounds and \\ncarotenoids, glucosinolates, organosulphur compounds, sesquiterpene lactones). Approximately there are more than 5000 individual phytochemicals have been \\nnoticed in fruits, vegetables but a large proportion of them remains unknown (Liu \\n2013). Bioactive compounds are the secondary metabolites of the plants, which \\nhave pharmacological and poisonous manifestations in man and animals (Bernhoft \\n2010). They generate important functions in the living cell such as defense against \\nJ.

The bioactive compound biosyn-\\nthesis is encouraged by light; hence they assemble in the skin and leaves of the fruits \\nand vegetables (Bernhoft 2010). The levels of the bioactive compounds in fruits and \\nvegetables differs based on genetic factors, environmental conditions such as light, \\nmaturity and postharvest treatments (Deepa et\\xa0al. 2007; Vallejo et\\xa0al. 2003). The \\nVitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds of fruits and vegetables are in the \\nliquid form which makes them more bioavailable in the human diet (Yildiz and \\nGültekin 2006). The advantages from the intake of fruits and vegetables, seems to be related to \\nadditive interactions between the phytochemicals that could affect different path-\\nways such as changes in cholesterol and hormone metabolism, enhances immune \\nresponse, modulation of steroid hormone concentration and detoxifying enzymes, \\nreduction of blood pressure, stimulates antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant activ-\\nity, lowers inflammatory processes, anti-carcinogenic properties and delay of car-\\ndiovascular diseases (Yu and Ahmedna 2013). It is a fact that fruits and vegetables \\ncan be processed for economical and logistical reasons to improve their commercial \\nshelf-life and digestibility fallowing the consumer habits of each country or to facil-\\nitate the consumption by special groups (children, pregnant women, older adults \\nand patients with certain pathologies). Foods that convey a specific, documented health promoting and disease pre-\\nventing property beyond the basic function of supplying nutrients are termed \\n‘functional foods.’ Functional foods are an emerging science area. Currently, the \\nfunctional food industry is encountering rapid growth due to the innovation of \\nnew products, and associated marketing, based upon the bioactivity of polyphe-\\nnolic compounds. These products report the wellness trend and the needs of \\nhealth-conscious consumers across infinite health areas (Gibson et\\xa0 al. 2000; \\nKathleen 1999). Another aspect of the success of functional foods is that they \\ntaste great and be convenient. Fruits have more health halo than vegetables and \\nwith their intrinsic sweetness, generally good taste, texture and convenience in \\nportability; they are much more attractive to consumers. Our aim is the provi-\\nsion of appropriate information to plant breeding teams, to select for scientifi-\\ncally proven health-promoting fruits and vegetables as whole fresh \\nfunctional foods. Fruits and vegetables producing crops are classified based on their climatic \\nadaptability (Table\\xa014.1). They are tropical, subtropical, temperate and arctic fruits \\nand vegetables. Tropical crops survive in the region between tropic of Cancer (23° \\n27”N latitude) and tropic of Capricorn (23° 27”S latitude), need a moist warm cli-\\nmate, resist dry weather and are evergreen. Sub-tropical fruits grow between tem-\\nperate and tropical climatic conditions (either evergreen or deciduous). They are \\nadapted to low temperatures. Temperate crops are those which survive in extreme \\ncold. They are deciduous and become dormant in winter. The Arctic is a cold tem-\\nperature region, a few crops thrive in such extreme frost conditions.

Macronutrients are required in larger amounts and are mainly carbohydrates, pro-\\nteins, and fats. Micronutrients are only needed in smaller quantities. Common \\nmicronutrients are vitamins and minerals. Vitamins devote the maintenance of \\nhealthy vision, immune function, bone health; cell integrity helps regulate calcium \\nand phosphorus. Fruits are rich in vitamin C, A and E. Minerals may reduce the risk \\nof high blood pressure and stroke. Copper and manganese are cofactors of the anti-\\noxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is required for the production of red \\nblood cells.

A variety of flavanones are present in fruits and vegetables. Hesperetin- regenerates vitamin C. It inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, rep-\\nlication of viruses like polio, herpes, and flu (Divya and Pandey 2014). They have \\nchemopreventive effects. They are used in treating hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and \\nlymphedema Naringenin acts as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypo-\\nlipidemic and vasoprotective (Gardana et\\xa0al. 2007). Narirutin used in the treatment \\nof bronchial asthma (Funaguchi et\\xa0al. 2007). Flavonols\\u2003 They occur in un-glycosylated forms. It includes catechins and proan-\\nthocyanidins. Catechins (Flavan-3-ols) It acts as an anticarcinogen in the lungs, \\nstomach, esophagus, duodenum, liver, pancreas, mammary gland. It also prevents \\nchronic inflammation associated with carcinogenesis and cardiovascular disease \\n(Cheynier et\\xa0al. 2000). Quercetins effective in protecting Low Density Lipoprotein \\nfrom oxidation, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. It inhibits oxidation of LDL \\nthus reducing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases; inhibit colon cancer \\n(David et\\xa0al. 2016). Kaempferol It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant proper-\\nties. Proanthocyanidins. They are oligomers of catechin and epicatechin and their \\ngallic acid esters. They form tannins. Anthocyanins\\u2003 These are watersoluble plant pigments, responsible for the red, blue \\nand purple colors of fruits (Rufino et\\xa0al. 2010). Cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, \\npeonidin and malvidin are the classes (Mazza and Miniati 1993). It has antioxidant \\nproperties. It enhances immune suppressive mechanisms, anti-allergic, anti-\\xad\\ninflammatory, antimicrobial and anti-cancer (uterine carcinoma and colon adeno-\\ncarcinoma) (Cheynier et\\xa0al. 2000). Flavones\\u2003 Apigenin, luteolin and tangeretin are important edible flavones. Apigenin- \\nused in the treatment of HIV, inflammatory bowel disease and skin conditions \\n(Duthie and Crozier 2000), prostate cancer and cervical cancer (Gupta et\\xa0al. 2002). Luteolin exhibits anti mutagenic, anti tumerigenic, antioxidant and has anti-\\xad\\ninflammatory properties (Kim et\\xa0al. 1999). Tangeretin is a polymethoxylated fla-\\nvone, stops cancer cell proliferation, breast cancer (Marc et\\xa0al. 1999). Carotenoids\\u2003 They inhibit the cell proliferation of human endometrium, mammary \\ngland, and lungs. β- Carotene neutralizes free radicals, which may damage cells. β- Carotene and lutein are orange and yellow carotenoids. They minimize liver can-\\ncer and lung cancer (Pueyo and Polo 1992). Β Carotene boosts the activity of natu-\\nral killer immune cells. It gives cornea protection against UV light. Zeaxanthin \\ngrants to the preservation of healthy vision. Lutein may protect against colon can-\\ncer. Lycopene aids in the continuation of prostate health. Phenolic Acids\\u2003 Separated into two classes- hydroxybenzoic acids and hydroxycin-\\nnamic acids. Hydroxybenzoic acid-Gallic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid are common types. J.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='Kaparapu et al. 251\\nHydroxycinnamic acid- Phenols and hydroxycinnamic acid inhibit the formation of \\ncarcinogen metabolites. Chlorogenic acid prevents colon cancer, helps in the \\nmaintenance of cardiac health and prevents various tumors. It also possesses \\nchemopreventive properties. Ferulic acid- inhibits carcinogen metabolites. Stilbenoids: They are glycosylated forms of stilbenes. Resveratrol in grapes acts \\nas an antioxidant, anti-aging agent, reducing the oxidative damage in the DNA of \\nneuronal cells (Nazar et\\xa0al. 2006). It has an anticancer factor against colon and \\nprostate cancers. It is beneficial in coronary heart disease by preventing vasodila-\\ntion and platelet aggregation (Niles et\\xa0al. 2003). It protects against age related \\nmacular degeneration (King et\\xa0al. 2005). It has a role in preventing Alzheimer’s \\ndisease and viral/fungal infections. Dietary Fibers\\u2003 Insoluble fiber may accord to the perpetuation of a healthy diges-\\ntive tract (Dreher 2018). Soluble fibre may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease \\nand some types of cancer. Cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin are some examples. Proteins\\u2003 Proteins in the form of enzymes play a significant role in free radical \\nscavenging activities Polyphenol oxidases, peroxides, phenolase, phosphatase, pro-\\nteases, pectin, Methyl esterase (PME), polygalacturonasen etc. are enzymes present \\nin the skin (Shahidi and Naczk 1995). Bromelain of the pineapple has significant \\nanti-inflammatory effects in acute sinusitis, sore throat, arthritis and speeding recov-\\nery from injuries. Bromelain also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, dia-\\nbetic ulcers, angina pectoris and general surgery. Pineapple is an excellent cerebral \\ntoner that combats loss of memory sadness and melancholy. Prebiotics\\u2003 They are non-digestible carbohydrates that cannot be broken down by \\nthe body. They are food sources for probiotic organisms. Some vegetables and fruits can be classified as super foods, referring to foods \\nthat provide utmost nutritional benefits for minimal calories. They are packed with \\nvitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The term “superfood” was used as a marketing \\ntool for selling specific foods, dietary supplements, foods with selected food addi-\\ntives (Fitzgerald 2014). “Super food” products were sold at a greater price than \\nsimilar foods without the label. As there is no official scientific definition of a super food by regulatory authori-\\nties in major consumer markets, such as the United States Food and Drug \\nAdministration and Department of Agriculture or the European Food Safety \\nAuthority (Brown 2010), but it is generally accepted that super foods contain high \\nlevels of vitamins and minerals. They can be a source of antioxidants, substances \\nthat protect from cell damage, preventing cancer. They also possess healthy fats that \\nprevent heart disease, fiber thought to ward off diabetes and digestive problems; and \\nphytochemicals, responsible for deep colors and odors which have many health \\nbenefits. Super fruits are a subset of super foods (Srinivasan 2008). The designation \\nof a fruit as a super fruit is entirely up to the product manufacturer, as the term is \\nprimarily used to create consumer demand (Starling 2008). Following are the list of \\nsome super foods. 14\\u2003 Fruits and\\xa0Vegetables and\\xa0its Nutritional Benefits\\n\\n252\\n14.4\\u2003 \\x07Dark Green Leafy Vegetables\\nThese are rich in folate, zinc, calcium, iron, magnesium, vitamin C and fiber. They \\nminimize the probability of chronic illnesses including heart disease and type 2 \\ndiabetes (Blekkenhorst et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2008; Wang et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2016). They also contain high levels \\nof carotenoids (anti-inflammatory compounds), protect against certain types of can-\\ncer (Xavier and Perez-Galvez 2016). Some well-known Dark green leafy vegetables \\nconsidered as super foods include Kale, Swiss chard, Collard greens, Turnip greens, \\nSpinach. Kale is a good source of minerals, antioxidants and vitamins A, C and \\nK. It also contains antioxidants lutein and beta-carotene, which prevents the risk of \\ndiseases due to oxidative stress (Lien et\\xa0 al. 2008). Collard greens are reliable \\nsources of calcium an vitamins A, B9 (folate), C and K (Weber 2001). Spinach is \\nrich in manganese vitamin K and A. It’s also packed with folate, which plays a key \\nrole in red blood cell production and the prevention of neural tube defects in preg-\\nnancy (Furness et\\xa0al. 2013). Swiss Chard is rich in the minerals potassium, manga-\\nnese and vitamins A, C, and K. Swiss chard also contains a unique flavonoid called \\nsyringic acid, a compound that may be beneficial for lowering blood sugar levels \\n(Young-Hee Pyo et\\xa0al. 2004). Turnip greens accommodate diverse antioxidants \\nincluding glucotropaeolin, gluconasturtiin, quercetin, myricetin and beta-carotene, \\netc., effective in lowering stress you’re the risk of heart disease, cancer and inflam-\\nmation (Lin and Harnly 2010). 14.5\\u2003 \\x07Green Leafy Vegetables\\nGreen leafy vegetables contain folic acid (B vitamin) that prevent birth defects, \\nheart disease, dementia, colon cancer, vision loss and protects skin and bones. Green leafy vegetables are a source of lutein which prevents macular degeneration \\n(a cause of age-related vision loss), cataracts and protect skin from the adverse \\neffects of sun exposure. Lutein preserves the fats in the top layer of skin, halting \\ndehydration, roughness and even wrinkles. Green leafy vegetables are rich in vita-\\nmin K, necessary for bone development. Examples include: Micro greens- \\nMicrogreens are immature greens developed from the seeds of vegetables and herbs, \\nmeasure 1–3 inches. Microgreens contain up to 40 times more nutrients compared \\nto their mature counterparts including vitamins C, E and K (Xiao et\\xa0 al. 2012). Cabbage is formed of clusters of thick leaves that come in green, white and purple \\ncolors. Vegetables in Brassica family contain glucosinolates may have cancer-\\xad\\nprotective properties against lung and esophageal cancer (Johnson 2002). Cabbage \\ncan be fermented and turned into a sauerkraut, which improves digestion, boosts the \\nimmune system and aids weight loss (Gupta and Garg 2009). Beet Greens rich in \\npotassium, calcium, riboflavin, fiber and vitamins A and K. fiber. They also contain \\nthe antioxidants beta-carotene and lutein, which inhibit the risk of eye disorders, \\nsuch as macular degeneration and cataracts (Semba and Dagnelie 2003). Watercress \\nJ.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='Kaparapu et al. 253\\nis an aquatic plant from the Brassicaceae family. Watercress extract is beneficial in \\ntargeting cancer stem cells and impairing cancer cell reproduction and invasion \\n(Boyd et\\xa0al. 2006). Romaine Lettuce is an excellent source of vitamins A and K \\nwhich is important for good health (Nicolle et\\xa0al. 2004). Arugula is a leafy green \\nfrom the Brassicaceae family. It’s also one of the best sources of dietary nitrates, \\nmay help increase blood flow and reduce blood pressure by widening your blood \\nvessels (Kapil et\\xa0al. 2015). Endive belongs to the Cichorium family, rich in vitamin \\nK, A and folate. It’s also a source of kaempferol, an antioxidant reduces inflamma-\\ntion and inhibits the growth of cancer cells in test-tube studies (Chen and Chen \\n2013). Bok Choy is a variety of Chinese cabbage. Bok Choy is popular in China \\nand often used in soups and stir-fries. It contains the mineral selenium, which ben-\\nefits brain health, immunity, cancer protection and thyroid health (Ventura \\net\\xa0al. 2017). 14.6\\u2003 \\x07Cruciferous Vegetables\\nCruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage and Brussels) possess sulforaphane an \\nenzyme that detoxifies carcinogens before they damage cells. Cruciferous vegeta-\\nbles prevent the development of cancer cells in the breast, uterine lining (endome-\\ntrium), lung, colon, liver and cervix. Isothiocyanates from cruciferous vegetables \\naids in the conversion of estrogen and other hormones into forms that are more \\neasily excreted from the body. Diets rich in cruciferous and dark yellow veggies \\nhelps to defend against cardiovascular disease. Vitamin C, beta carotene and potas-\\nsium are the other significant nutrients of cruciferous vegetables. Sweet potato is a \\nroot vegetable stuffed with a variety of nutrients, including potassium, fiber vita-\\nmins A and C, carotenoids of sweet potato inhibits the risk of cancer (Tanaka et\\xa0al. 2012). Interestingly, they may improve blood sugar control in those with type 2 \\ndiabetes (Ooi and Loke 2013). The Onions family and related super foods including \\ngarlic and leeks have a wide range of nutritional and health benefits. Naturally con-\\ntrols blood sugar in diabetics, very good source of daily fiber and natural sugars \\n(Morris 2012). Onions used as disinfectants (sulfur content), a diuretic, anti-emetic, \\nstimulant, expectorant, and fight colds. Onions contain selenium, an important \\nnutrient. Red onions are rich in anthocyanins, which are powerful plant pigments \\nthat may protect against heart disease, certain cancers and diabetes (Slimestad \\net\\xa0al. 2007). 14.7\\u2003 \\x07Orange Fruits and\\xa0Vegetables\\nBeta carotene of orange vegetables and fruits such as sweet potatoes, squash, pump-\\nkins, carrots, mangos, oranges and papayas possess beta carotene, an anti-oxidant \\nthat helps protect healthy skin cells and block sun damage (Schulz 2004). Beta \\n14\\u2003 Fruits and\\xa0Vegetables and\\xa0its Nutritional Benefits\\n\\n254\\ncarotene is necessary for the lining of membranes in the mouth, throat, lungs, stom-\\nach, intestines, urinary tract and the reproductive tract. It also helps night vision. Manganese, copper, fiber, vitamin B-6, potassium and iron are the other nutrients in \\norange fruits and vegetables. Berries\\u2003 Berries are boosted with vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. The \\nstrong antioxidant property of berries reduce threat of heart disease, cancer and \\nother inflammatory conditions (Skrovankova et\\xa0al. 2015; Manganaris et\\xa0al. 2014). Berries are effcient in eliminating digestive and immune-related disorders (Govers \\net\\xa0al. 2018). Some of the most common berries include: Raspberries, Strawberries, \\nBlueberries, Blackberries, Cranberries. Blueberries are considered to improve \\nmemory, brain function, heart function; inhibits the risks of cancer, reduce choles-\\nterol; act as an anti-inflammatory and have anti-aging benefits etc. Blueberries are a \\ngreat add-in for smoothies, yogurt, salads or just to eat alone (Seeram 2008). Canberries are rich in high phenol content that help to lower the oxidation of the \\nLDL cholesterol. Proanthocyanidins in Cranberries’ can protect against urinary \\ntract infections. The antioxidants and other nutrients in Cranberries enhance immune \\nfunction, helps digestion, decrease the risk of heart-problems and possess anti-aging \\nproperties. Pomegranates\\u2003 are an antioxidant rich fruit used for treating diarrhea, excessive \\nperspiring, recurrent fevers, sore throats. It also used as an astringent. Bark, rind, \\nand seeds of pomegranates are frequently used Avocado is a good source of many \\nnutrients, including fiber, vitamins, minerals and healthy fats, monounsaturated fats \\n(Dreher and Davenport 2013). Oleic acid is the most predominant MUFA in avo-\\ncado, which reduces inflammation in the body (Sales-Campos et\\xa0al. 2013). Avocado \\nmay reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and certain \\ntypes of cancer (Fulgoni 3rd et\\xa0al. 2013; Wang et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2015; Ding et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2007). 14.8\\u2003 \\x07Conclusion\\nFood is a substance that we eat which provides nutrition to maintain growth and \\nsustain life. Instead of having anything to consume, it will be good to take food \\nwhich provides us both flavor and health. As the Father of Medicine, Hippocrates \\nsaid more than 2000\\xa0years ago “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy \\nfood”. Fruits and vegetables are a good source for obtaining phytochemicals with \\nhigh antioxidant activity and other beneficial health properties. The utilization of \\nthese low-cost renewable resources could be prepared for the pharmaceutical, nutra-\\nceutical, and food industries with the opportunity of developing new nutraceutical \\nand pharmaceutical products. Studies are to be focused on elucidating the possible \\nmode of action of bioactive compounds. It is also aimed to prevent deteriorative \\nreactions as well as identify their specific contribution to the total antioxidant capac-\\nity. Furthermore, encompassing the efforts of food technologists, nutritionists and \\nJ. Kaparapu et al. 255\\nphysicians will lead to the development of programs to raise awareness of the great \\nhealth advantages that fruit and vegetable consumption offers.

Whole grains, refined cereals, and legumes are important \\ncomponents of diet in many parts of the world. They are major source of energy, \\nproteins, and other nutrients (Tayyem et\\xa0al. 2016; Dias-Martins et\\xa0al.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\FruitsandVegetablesanditsNutritionalBenefits.pdf'}, page_content='2018). The \\nconcept of functional food includes foods or food ingredients that exert a beneficial \\neffect on health and/or reduce the risk of chronic diseases beyond basic nutritional \\nfunctions. Increasing awareness of consumer health and interest in functional foods \\nto achieve a healthy lifestyle has resulted in the need for food products with versa-\\ntile health-benefiting properties. Cereal and cereal based food products offer oppor-\\ntunities to include probiotics, prebiotics, and fibres in the human diet (Das et\\xa0al. 2012). Dietary guidelines has it that the high nutrient density of breakfast cereals \\n(especially those that are whole grain or high in cereal fibre) makes them an impor-\\ntant source of key nutrients in addition to providing an important source of vitamins \\nand minerals. Breakfast cereals are also potentially important source of antioxidants \\nand phytoestrogens and are one of the most important sources of whole grains \\n(Williams 2014). A whole grain is a grain of any cereal and pseudo cereal that contains the endo-\\nsperm, germ, and bran, in contrast to refine grains, which retain only the endosperm \\n(Aune et\\xa0al. 2016). There are a lot of supportive evidence showing that the con-\\nsumption of whole grains and whole-grain-based products are associated with the \\nreduction of the risk of developing many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, \\nS.

This 18th edition of the Motorcycle Safety Foundation Motorcycle Operator \\nManual* contains tips and strategies to help riders manage risk. The manual was \\nwritten for novices and designed for use in licensing programs, but there’s great \\ninformation for all two- and three-wheel motorcycle riders. Topics covered include \\nmotorcycle controls, developing effective street strategies, group riding, riding with \\na passenger, and more. Additional resources are available at MSF-USA.org, including the new MSF \\nBasic eCourse, with interactive online exercises. But the best way to learn to ride \\nis through formal hands-on training, like with the MSF Basic RiderCourse, where \\nyou’ll learn how to properly operate a motorcycle with the help of MSF-certified \\nRiderCoaches. Making motorcycling safer, and as a result more fun, is our goal.

Not as a passive driver, but as an active \\nrider leaning into a string of smooth \\ncorners, playing along with the rhythm \\nof the road; shifting, accelerating, and \\nbraking with precision. Whether you \\nride to and from work or prefer the \\ncamaraderie of a group ride on the \\nweekend, motorcycling engages all your \\nsenses and creates an exhilarating sense \\nof freedom. Along with that freedom comes \\nresponsibility. All states require some \\nform of license or endorsement to \\ndemonstrate you possess a minimum \\nlevel of skill and knowledge. This booklet \\nand other motorcycle publications can \\nhelp prepare you to be successful. You \\nmight also consider taking a formal \\nhands-on training course, even if your \\nstate doesn’t require that you complete \\none. You’ll learn how to improve your \\nriding skills and mental strategies, so you \\ncan be a safer, more alert rider and enjoy \\nriding that much more. The diagram above illustrates the \\ncomplex environment that awaits you, \\nand supports the concept that, as the \\nMotorcycle Safety Foundation says, “Safe \\nriding depends as much on the mental \\nskills of awareness and judgment as it \\ndoes on the physical skill of maneuvering \\nthe machine.”\\nSuccessfully operating a motorcycle is \\na much more involved task than driving \\na car. Motorcycling requires strength, \\ncoordination, and balance, as well as \\na heightened sense of awareness and \\nposition amidst other roadway users. A \\nmotorcycle is more responsive than a \\ncar, but is also more sensitive to outside \\nforces, like irregular road surfaces or \\ncrosswinds. A motorcycle is also less \\nvisible than a car due to its narrower \\nprofile, and offers far less protection by \\nexposing its rider to other traffic and the \\nelements. All these risks can be managed \\nthrough training and education. RIDING ENVIRONMENT\\nTHE RIDER AND THE MOTORCYCLE\\n\\n4\\x08\\nPREPARING TO RIDE\\nPREPARING TO RIDE\\x08\\n4\\nWhat you do before you begin a ride goes a long way toward riding safely \\nand effectively. Before any ride, a safety-minded rider makes a point to: \\n1. Wear the right gear. 2. Become familiar with the motorcycle. 3. Check the motorcycle parts and controls. WEAR THE RIGHT GEAR\\nWhen you ride, your gear is “right” \\nif it protects you. In any crash, you have \\na far better chance of avoiding serious \\ninjury if you wear:\\n\\uf06e\\tA DOT-compliant helmet. \\uf06e\\tFace or eye protection. \\uf06e\\tProtective clothing. Helmet Use\\nCrashes can occur — particularly \\namong untrained, beginning riders. And one out of every five motorcycle \\ncrashes results in head or neck injuries. Head injuries are just as severe as neck \\ninjuries — and far more common. Crash \\nanalyses show that head and neck \\ninjuries account for a majority of serious \\nand fatal injuries to motorcyclists. Research also shows that, with few \\nexceptions, head and neck injuries are \\nreduced by properly wearing a quality \\nhelmet. Some riders choose not to wear a \\nhelmet. But, here are some facts to \\nconsider:\\n\\uf06e\\tA DOT-compliant helmet\\x03 lets you \\nsee as far to the sides as necessary. Studies show that a helmet does not \\nkeep a rider from spotting danger. \\uf06e\\tMost crashes happen\\x03 on short trips \\n(less than five miles long), just a few \\nminutes after starting out. \\uf06e\\tMost riders\\x03 are riding slower than \\n30 mph when a crash occurs. At \\nthese speeds, helmets can cut both \\nthe number and the severity of head \\nand neck injuries by half. No matter what the speed, helmeted \\nriders are three times more likely to \\nsurvive head injuries than those not \\nwearing helmets at the time of the \\ncrash. The single most important thing \\nyou can do to improve your chances if \\nyou crash is to wear a securely fastened, \\nquality helmet. Helmet Selection\\nRecommended are two primary types \\nof helmets, providing two different \\nlevels of coverage: three-quarter and full \\nface. Whichever style you choose, you can \\nget the most protection by making sure \\nthat the helmet:\\n\\uf06e\\tIs designed to meet U.S.\\x03 \\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \\nand state standards. Helmets with \\na label from the Snell Memorial \\nFoundation also give you an \\nassurance of quality. \\uf06e\\tFits snugly,\\x03 all the way around. \\uf06e\\tHas no obvious defects\\x03 such as \\ncracks, loose padding or frayed \\nstraps. Whatever helmet you decide on, keep \\nit securely fastened on your head when \\nyou ride. Otherwise, if you are involved \\nin a crash, it might fly off your head \\n\\nCONTENTS \\x08\\n5\\n5\\x08\\nbefore it gets a chance to \\nprotect you. Eye and Face \\nProtection\\nA plastic impact-resistant \\nfaceshield can help protect \\nyour whole face in a crash. It also protects you from \\nwind, dust, dirt, rain, insects \\nand pebbles thrown up \\nfrom cars ahead.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\motorcycle-operator-manual.pdf'}, page_content='These \\nproblems are distracting \\nand can be painful.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\motorcycle-operator-manual.pdf'}, page_content='If you \\nhave to deal with them, you \\ncan’t devote your full attention to the \\nroad.

Soles should \\nbe made of hard, durable, slip-\\nresistant material. Keep heels short so \\nthey do not catch on rough surfaces.

Borrowing and Lending\\nBorrowers and lenders of motorcycles, \\nbeware. Crashes are more likely to occur \\namong beginning riders — especially \\nin the first months of riding. Riding an \\nunfamiliar motorcycle adds risk. If you \\nborrow a motorcycle, get familiar with \\nit away from traffic.

Be very familiar \\nwith the friction zone for manual \\ntransmissions. \\uf06e\\tRide very cautiously\\x03 and be aware \\nof surroundings. Accelerate gently, \\ntake turns more slowly and leave \\nextra room for stopping. Check Your Motorcycle\\nA motorcycle needs more frequent \\nattention than a car. A minor technical \\nfailure on a car is seldom more than an \\ninconvenience for the driver. The same \\nfailure on a motorcycle may result in a \\ncrash or having to leave your motorcycle \\nparked on the side of the road. If \\nanything’s wrong with your motorcycle, \\nyou’ll want to find out about it before \\nyou get in traffic. The primary source of information \\nabout how a motorcycle should be \\ninspected and maintained is its owner’s \\nmanual. Be sure to absorb all of its \\nimportant information. A motorcycle \\nwill continue to ride like new if it is \\nmaintained and routine inspections \\nbecome part of its maintenance. A pre-ride inspection only takes \\na few minutes and should be done \\nbefore every ride to prevent problems. It’s quick and easy to check the critical \\ncomponents and it should be as routine \\nand automatic as checking the weather \\nforecast before heading out for the day. A convenient reminder developed by \\nMSF is T-CLOCSSM. There is a T-CLOCS \\n“tear-out” sheet at the back of this \\nmanual for you to keep. A T-CLOCS \\ninspection should be conducted before \\nevery ride, and includes checks of:\\nT — Tires and Wheels\\n\\uf06e Check tire inflation pressure, \\ntreadwear and general condition of \\nsidewalls and tread surface. \\uf06e Try the front and rear brake levers one \\nat a time.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\motorcycle-operator-manual.pdf'}, page_content='Make sure each feels firm \\nand holds the motorcycle when fully \\napplied.

The schedule for regular upkeep \\nfor motorcycle parts and controls is \\ncontained in the motorcycle’s owner’s \\nmanual. KNOW YOUR \\nRESPONSIBILITIES\\n“Accident” implies an unforeseen \\nevent that occurs without fault or \\nnegligence. In traffic, that is not the \\ncase.

That’s something you can learn only through \\npractice, preferably in a formal course of instruction like an MSF RiderCourse. But control begins with knowing your abilities and riding within them, along \\nwith knowing and obeying the rules of the road. BASIC VEHICLE CONTROL\\nBody Position\\nTo control a motorcycle well:\\n\\uf06e\\tPosture\\x03 — Position yourself \\ncomfortably so you are able to \\noperate all the controls and steer \\neffectively. This helps you interact well \\nwith your motorcycle and allows you \\nto react quickly to hazards. \\uf06e\\tSeat\\x03 — Sit far enough forward so \\nthat arms are slightly bent when you \\nhold the handgrips. Bending your \\narms permits you to press on the \\nhandlebars without having to reach \\ntoo far. \\uf06e\\tHands\\x03 — Hold the handgrips \\nfirmly to keep your grip over rough \\nsurfaces. Start with your right wrist \\nflat. This will help you keep from \\naccidentally using too much throttle. Also, adjust the handlebars so your \\nhands are even with or below your \\nHOLDING HANDGRIPS\\nelbows. This permits you to use the \\nproper muscles for proper steering. \\uf06e\\tKnees\\x03 — Keep your knees against \\nthe gas tank to help you keep your \\nbalance as the motorcycle turns. \\uf06e\\tFeet\\x03 — Keep your feet firmly on the \\nfootrests to maintain balance. Don’t \\ndrag your feet. If your foot catches \\non something, you could be injured \\nand it could affect your control of \\nthe motorcycle. Keep your feet near \\nthe controls so you can get to them \\neasily if needed. Also, don’t let your \\ntoes point downward — they may \\nget caught between the road and the \\nfootrests. Shifting Gears\\nThere is more to shifting gears than \\nsimply getting the motorcycle to pick \\nup speed smoothly. Learning to use the \\ngears when downshifting, turning or \\nstarting on hills is equally important for \\nsafe motorcycle operation. The gearshift lever is located in front \\nof the left footrest and is operated by \\nthe left foot. To shift “up” to a higher \\ngear, position your foot under the shift \\nlever and lift and release. To downshift, \\npress the shift lever down and release. The shift lever changes one gear \\neach time it is lifted or pressed down. Whenever the lever is released, spring \\nloading returns it to center, where the \\nmechanism resets for the next shift up \\nor down. A typical gear pattern is 1-N-\\n2-3-4-5. The N is for neutral, which is \\nselected by either a “half lift” from 1st \\ngear or a “half press” from 2nd gear. \\x08\\n11\\n11\\nMost motorcycles have five gears, but \\nsome have four or six gears. As your motorcycle increases \\nspeed, you will need to shift up to a \\nhigher gear. Shift up well before the \\nengine RPM reaches its maximum \\nrecommended speed. As a general rule, \\nshift up soon enough to avoid over-\\nrevving the engine, but not so soon to \\ncause the engine to lug. When upshifting, use a 3-step \\nprocess: 1) Roll off the throttle as you \\nsqueeze the clutch lever, 2) lift the \\nshift lever firmly as far as it will go and \\nrelease, 3) smoothly ease out the clutch \\nlever and adjust the throttle. You should shift down through the \\ngears using the clutch lever as you slow \\nor stop. You can also shift down when \\nyou need more power to accelerate. Make certain you are riding slowly \\nenough when you shift into a lower \\ngear. If not, the motorcycle will lurch, \\nand the rear wheel may skid. When \\nriding downhill or shifting into first gear \\nyou may need to use the brakes to slow \\nsufficiently before downshifting safely. When downshifting, use a 3-step \\nprocess: 1) Roll off the throttle as you \\nsqueeze the clutch lever, 2) press the \\nshift lever down firmly and release, 3) \\nease out the clutch lever as you roll \\non the throttle. Rolling on the throttle \\nslightly while smoothly easing out the \\nclutch lever can help the engine come \\nup to speed more quickly and make the \\ndownshift smoother. Shifting to a lower \\ngear causes an effect similar to using the \\nbrakes. This is known as engine braking. To use engine braking, shift down one \\ngear at a time and ease out the clutch \\nlever through the friction zone between \\neach downshift. Stay in the friction zone \\nuntil the engine speed stabilizes. Then \\nease out the lever fully until ready for \\nthe next downshift. Usually you shift \\ngears one at a time, but it is possible to \\nshift through more than one gear while \\nthe clutch lever is squeezed. Remain in first gear while you are \\nstopped so that you can move out \\nquickly if you need to. Work toward a smooth, even \\nclutch lever release, especially when \\ndownshifting. It is best to change \\ngears before entering a turn. However, \\nsometimes shifting while in the turn \\nis necessary. If so, remember to do so \\nsmoothly. A sudden change in power to \\nthe rear wheel can cause a skid. Braking\\nImproper braking remains a significant \\ncontributing factor in many motorcycle \\ncrashes. Most motorcycles have two \\nbrake controls: one for the front wheel \\nand one for the rear wheel. Always use \\nboth brakes every time you slow or stop. The front brake is more powerful and \\ncan provide 70% or more of your total \\nstopping power. The front brake is safe \\nto use if you use it properly. Maximum straight-line braking is \\naccomplished by fully applying both \\nfront and rear brakes without locking \\neither wheel. To do this:\\n\\uf06e\\tSqueeze the front brake smoothly, \\nSHIFTING GEARS\\n\\n12\\x08\\n RIDE WITHIN YOUR ABILITIES\\nfirmly and with progressively more \\nforce. Do not grab the brake lever or \\nuse abrupt pressure. \\uf06e\\tAs the motorcycle’s weight \\ntransfers forward, more traction \\nbecomes available at the front wheel, \\nso the front brake can be applied \\nmore firmly after braking begins. \\uf06e\\tKeep your knees against the tank \\nand your eyes up, looking well ahead. This helps you stop the motorcycle in \\na straight line. \\uf06e\\tApply light-to-lighter pressure \\nto the rear brake pedal to prevent a \\nrear wheel skid. As weight transfers \\nforward less traction is available at \\nthe rear. Using both brakes for even “normal” \\nstops will permit you to develop the \\nproper skill of using both brakes \\nproperly in an emergency. Squeeze the \\nfront brake and press down on the rear. Grabbing at the front brake or jamming \\ndown on the rear can cause the brakes \\nto lock, resulting in control problems. Braking in a Corner\\nAny time a motorcycle is leaned over, \\nthe amount of traction available for \\nbraking is reduced. The greater the lean \\nangle, the more the possibility of the \\ntires losing traction. To stop as quickly and as safely as \\npossible in a curve, and depending on \\nroad and traffic conditions, try to get the \\nmotorcycle as perpendicular to the road \\nas possible, then brake. If conditions do \\nnot allow, brake smoothly and gradually, \\nbut do not apply as much braking force \\nas you would if the motorcycle were \\nstraight up. As you slow, you can reduce \\nyour lean angle, and as more traction \\nbecomes available for braking, you can \\nmore firmly apply the brakes, so that \\nby the time the motorcycle is stopped, \\nthe motorcycle is straight up, and the \\nhandlebars are squared. Doing this well \\ntakes practice. Linked and Integrated \\nBraking Systems\\nSome motorcycles have linked braking \\nwhich connects the front and rear \\nbrakes on the motorcycle and applies \\nbraking pressure to both brakes when \\neither the front lever or rear pedal is \\napplied. An integrated braking system \\nis a variation of the linked system in \\nwhich partial front braking is applied \\nwhenever the rear brake is activated. Consult the owner’s manual for a \\ndetailed explanation on the operation \\nand effective use of these systems. Anti-Lock Braking Systems \\n(ABS) \\nABS is designed to prevent wheel \\nlock-up and avoid skids when stopping \\nin panic situations. ABS operates \\nwhen too much pressure is applied on \\neither the front or rear brake control. If \\nelectronic sensors detect a possible wheel \\nlock, brake pressure is released then \\nreapplied to maintain maximum braking \\neffectiveness if the brake controls remain \\napplied. ABS is capable of releasing and \\nreapplying pressure more than 15 times \\nper second. Turning\\nApproach turns and curves with \\ncaution.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\motorcycle-operator-manual.pdf'}, page_content='Riders often try to take curves \\nor turns too fast. When they can’t hold \\nthe turn, they end up crossing into \\nanother lane of traffic or going off the \\nroad. Or, they overreact and brake too \\nhard, causing a skid and loss of control. The following four steps will help you \\nlearn to turn effectively. Note that in \\nactual use these steps may overlap:\\n\\n\\x08\\n13\\n\\uf06e\\tSLOW\\x03 — Reduce speed before the \\nturn by closing the throttle and, if \\nnecessary, applying both brakes. \\uf06e\\tLOOK\\x03 — Look through the turn to \\nwhere you want to go. Turn just your \\nhead, not your shoulders, and keep \\nyour eyes level with the horizon. \\uf06e\\tPRESS\\x03 — To turn, the motorcycle \\nmust lean. To lean the motorcycle, \\npress on the handgrip in the direction \\nof the turn. Press left handgrip \\n— lean left — go left. Press right \\nhandgrip — lean right — go right. The higher the speed in a turn, or the \\nsharper the turn, the greater the lean \\nangle needs to be. \\uf06e\\tROLL\\x03 — Roll on the throttle to \\nmaintain or slightly increase speed. This helps stabilize the motorcycle. In regular turns, the rider and the \\nmotorcycle should lean together at the \\nsame angle. In slow, tight turns, counterbalance by \\nleaning the motorcycle only and keeping \\nyour body upright. KEEPING YOUR DISTANCE\\nIt is good to have a “cushion of \\nspace” separating yourself from other \\nvehicles on the roadway.

To gauge your following distance:\\nLANE POSITIONS\\n\\n\\x08\\n15\\n\\uf06e\\tPick out a marker,\\x03 such as a \\npavement marking or lamppost, on or \\nnear the road ahead. \\uf06e\\tWhen the rear of the vehicle ahead \\npasses the marker, count off the \\nseconds: “one-thousand-one, one-\\nthousand-two.”\\n\\uf06e\\tIf you reach the marker\\x03 before you \\nreach “two,” you are following too \\nclosely. A two-second following distance \\nleaves a minimum amount of space to \\nstop or swerve if the driver ahead stops \\nsuddenly.

It is common for drivers \\nto pull out in front of motorcyclists, \\nthinking they have plenty of time. Too \\noften, they are wrong. However, you can do many things to \\nmake it easier for others to recognize \\nyou and your motorcycle. Clothing\\nMost crashes occur during daylight \\nhours. Wear bright-colored clothing \\nto increase your chances of being \\nseen. Remember, your body is half of \\nthe visible surface area of the rider/\\nmotorcycle unit. Bright orange, red, yellow or green \\njackets/vests are your best bets for being \\nseen. Your helmet can do more than \\nprotect you in a crash. Brightly colored \\nhelmets can also help others see you. Any bright color is better than drab \\nor dark colors. Reflective, bright-colored \\nclothing (helmet and jacket/vest) is best. Reflective material on a vest and on \\nthe sides of the helmet will help drivers \\ncoming from the side to spot you. Reflective material can also be a big \\nhelp for drivers both ahead and behind.

Turning your signal light on before \\neach turn reduces confusion and \\nfrustration for the traffic around you. Once you turn, make sure your signal is \\noff or a driver may pull directly into your \\npath, thinking you plan to turn again. Use your signals at every turn so drivers \\ncan react accordingly. Don’t make them \\nguess what you intend to do. Brake Light\\nYour motorcycle’s brake light is usually \\nnot as noticeable as the brake lights \\non a car. If the situation will permit, \\nhelp others notice you by flashing your \\nbrake light before you slow down. It is \\nespecially important to flash your brake \\nlight before:\\n\\uf06e\\tYou slow more quickly\\x03 than others \\nmight expect (turning off a high-\\nspeed highway). \\uf06e\\tYou slow where\\x03 others may not \\nexpect it (in the middle of a block or \\nat an alley). \\uf06e\\tYou are stopped at an intersection \\nwith traffic approaching from behind. If you are being followed closely, it’s \\na good idea to flash your brake light \\nbefore you slow. The tailgater may be \\nwatching you and not see something \\nahead that will make you slow down. This will hopefully discourage them from \\ntailgating and warn them of hazards \\nahead they may not see.

Often, \\na crash occurs because a rider is not \\nprepared or skilled in crash-avoidance \\nmaneuvers. Know when and how to stop or \\nswerve, two skills critical in avoiding \\na crash. It is not always desirable or \\npossible to stop quickly to avoid an \\nobstacle. Riders must also be able to \\nswerve around an obstacle. Deter-\\nmining which skill is necessary for the \\nsituation is important as well. Studies show that most crash- \\ninvolved riders: \\n\\uf06e\\tUnderbrake\\x03 the front tire and \\noverbrake the rear. \\uf06e\\tDid not\\x03 separate braking from \\nswerving or did not choose swerving \\nwhen it was appropriate. The following information offers \\nsome good advice. Quick Stops\\nTo stop quickly, apply both brakes \\nat the same time. Don’t be shy about \\nusing the front brake, but don’t “grab” \\nit either. Squeeze the brake lever firmly \\nand progressively. If the front wheel \\nlocks, release the front brake lever \\nimmediately then reapply it firmly. At \\nthe same time, press down on the \\nrear brake. If you accidentally lock the \\nrear brake on a good traction surface, \\nyou can keep it locked until you have \\ncompletely stopped; even with a \\nlocked rear wheel, you can control the \\nmotorcycle if it is upright and going in a \\nstraight line. Stopping Quickly in a Curve\\nUsing both brakes in a turn is \\npossible, although it should be done \\nvery carefully. When leaning the \\nmotorcycle some of the traction is used \\nfor cornering. Less traction is available \\nfor stopping. A skid can occur if you \\napply too much brake. Also, using the \\nfront brake incorrectly on a slippery \\nsurface may be hazardous. Use caution \\nand squeeze the brake lever, never grab. If you must stop quickly while in \\na curve, first straighten and square \\nthe handlebars, then stop. If you find \\nyourself in a situation that does not allow \\nstraightening first, such as when there is \\na danger of running off the road in a left-\\nhand curve, or when facing oncoming \\ntraffic in a right-hand curve, apply the \\nbrakes smoothly and gradually. As you \\nslow, you can reduce your lean angle \\nand apply more brake pressure until the \\nmotorcycle is straight and maximum \\nbrake pressure can be applied. Always \\nstraighten the handlebars in the last few \\nfeet of stopping to maintain your balance \\nand remain upright. Swerving or Turning Quickly\\nSometimes you may not have enough \\nroom to stop, even if you use both \\nbrakes properly. You may encounter an \\nunexpected object in your path. Or the \\ncar ahead might squeal to a stop. The \\nonly way to avoid a crash may be to \\nturn quickly or swerve around it. A swerve is a sudden change in \\ndirection. Apply a small amount of hand \\npressure to the handlegrip located on \\nthe side of your intended direction of \\nescape. This will cause the motorcycle \\nto lean quickly. The sharper the desired \\nturn(s), the more the motorcycle must \\nlean. Keep your body upright and allow \\nthe motorcycle to lean in the direction \\nof the turn while keeping your knees \\nagainst the tank and your feet solidly on \\nthe footrests. Let the motorcycle move \\nunderneath you. Make your escape path \\nthe target of your vision. Press on the \\nopposite handlegrip once you’re clear \\n\\n\\x08\\n27\\nto return you to your original \\ndirection of travel. If the situation allows, \\nseparate braking from \\nswerving. Brake before or \\nafter – never while making an \\nagressive swerve. Maximum Straight-Line \\nBraking \\nMaximum straight-line \\nbraking is accomplished by \\nfully applying front and rear \\nbrakes without locking either \\nwheel. Keep your body centered over \\nthe motorcycle and look well ahead, \\nnot down. This will help you keep the \\nmotorcycle as straight as possible, \\nminimizing lean angle and the likelihood \\nof the tires losing traction. Front-Wheel Skids \\nIf the front wheel locks, release the \\nfront brake lever immediately, and \\nreapply with less pressure. Reapply the brake smoothly. Front-\\nwheel skids result in immediate loss of \\nsteering control and balance. Failure to \\nfully release the brake lever immediately \\nwill result in a crash. Rear-Wheel Skids\\nA skidding rear tire is a dangerous \\ncondition that can result in a violent \\ncrash. Too much rear brake pressure \\ncauses rear-wheel lockup. As soon \\nas the rear wheel locks, your ability \\nto change direction is lost. To regain \\ncontrol the brake must be released. However, if the rear wheel is out of \\nalignment with the front, there is a risk \\nof a high-side crash. This occurs when \\nthe wheels are out of alignment and \\na locked rear wheel is released.

GROUP RIDING\\nPreparation\\nPreparing yourself for a group ride \\nis as important as making sure your \\nmotorcycle is ready. Riding with a group \\nrequires an alert mind that is free from \\nworries, distractions and stress. It also \\nmeans riding free from the influence of \\nalcohol or drugs. For some, even too \\nmuch caffeine or prescription drugs can \\nadversely affect concentration. Prior to a long trip, it’s a good idea to \\nhave your motorcycle serviced at your \\nlocal dealership if you aren’t able to do \\nthe work yourself. A thorough pre-\\nride check is a must. Use the T-CLOCS \\nchecklist as a reminder of the important \\ncomponents to check before you leave. Remember to consider such variables \\nas passengers and extra weight from \\ncargo that might require a change in tire \\npressure or suspension adjustment. Plan\\nBefore starting out, hold a rider’s \\nmeeting to discuss the route, length of \\nriding segments, rest stops and locations \\nfor fuel, meals and lodging. Make sure \\neveryone knows the route. That way, \\nif someone becomes separated, he or \\nshe won’t have to hurry to keep from \\ngetting lost or making the wrong turn.

The lead rider \\nshould look ahead for changes in road, \\ntraffic or weather conditions, and signal \\nearly so the word gets back in plenty \\nof time to the other riders. The sweep \\nrider is the last rider in the group, and \\nsets the pace for the group. Place \\ninexperienced riders just behind the \\nleader. That ensures that they won’t \\nhave to chase after the group, and the \\nmore experienced riders can watch \\nthem from the back. The most important rules for group \\nriding are: no competition, no passing \\nof other riders and no tailgating. If a \\nrider insists on riding faster than the \\ngroup, allow him or her to go ahead to \\nan agreed meeting point.

If a rider falls behind, everyone \\nshould slow down to keep the group \\ntogether. Keep Your Distance\\nMaintain close ranks, but at the \\nsame time, maintain an adequate space \\ncushion to allow each rider in the group \\ntime and distance to react to hazards. A close group takes up less space on \\nthe highway, is easier to see, and is less \\nlikely to become separated. This must, \\nhowever, be done properly. Don’t Pair Up\\nNever ride directly alongside another \\nrider in the same lane. There is no place \\nto go if you have to maneuver to avoid \\na car or hazard in the roadway. Wait \\nuntil you are both stopped to talk. Staggered Formation\\nThis is the best way to keep the ranks \\nclose yet maintain an adequate space \\ncushion. The group leader rides in the \\nleft side of the lane, and the second \\nrider stays at least one second back and \\nrides in the right side of the lane. The \\nthird maintains the left position of the \\nlane, at least two seconds behind the \\nfirst rider. The fourth rider should keep \\nat least a two second distance from \\nthe second rider in the right side of the \\nlane, and so on. This formation keeps \\nthe group close and permits each rider \\nto maintain a safe distance from others \\nahead, behind and to the sides.

This will prevent riders from feeling \\npressured to speed up or run a red light. Interstate Highways and \\nFreeways\\nA staggered formation is essential \\nwhen riding on freeways and interstates. However, enter in single file and form up \\nonly after all riders have safely merged \\nin traffic. The lead rider should move the \\ngroup over at least one lane to prevent \\nvehicles that are entering and exiting \\nfrom disrupting your formation. In heavy \\ntraffic, resist the temptation to ride too \\nclose together. Maintain your minimum \\none-second, two-second staggered \\nformation space cushion. When exiting, \\nuse a single file formation for better \\nspace cushion and time to react to \\nconditions at the end of the off-ramp. Parking\\nWhen possible, park as a group, so \\neveryone can get off their motorcycles \\nmore quickly. Avoid parking downhill or \\nhead-in, and if possible, park where you \\ncan pull through, making the arrival and \\ndeparture smoother. Whenever possible, \\npark so that the group can depart as a \\nunit in single file. Passing in Formation\\nWhen the group wants to pass slow \\ntraffic on a freeway or interstate, the \\ngroup may pass as a unit. On a two-lane \\nhighway, riders in a staggered formation \\nshould pass one at a time. \\uf06e\\tFirst, the lead rider should pull out \\nand pass when it is safe. After passing \\nthe leader should return to the left \\nposition and continue riding at passing \\nspeed to open room for the next rider. \\uf06e\\tNext, the second rider should move \\nup to the left position in the lane \\nand wait for a chance to safely pass. When passing be sure you have \\na clear view of oncoming traffic. Just because the lead rider passed, \\nthat does not mean that conditions \\nhaven’t changed and that it is still \\nsafe for other riders to pass. After \\npassing the rider should return to the \\nright position and open up room for \\nthe next rider. Some people suggest that the lead \\nrider should move to the right side \\nof the lane after passing the vehicle. This is not a good idea, since it might \\nencourage the second rider to pass and \\ncut back in before there is enough space \\ncushion in front of the passed vehicle. It’s simpler and safer to wait until there \\nis enough room ahead of the passed \\nvehicle to allow each rider to move into \\nthe same position held before the pass.

Skilled riders pay \\nattention to the riding environment and to operating the motorcycle, identifying \\npotential hazards, making good judgments and executing decisions quickly and \\nskillfully. Your ability to perform and respond to changing roadway and traffic \\nconditions is influenced by how fit and alert you are. Alcohol and drugs, more \\nthan any other factor, degrade your ability to think clearly and to ride skillfullly. As \\nlittle as one drink can have a significant effect on performance. Let’s look at the risks involved in riding after drinking or using drugs. What to \\ndo to protect yourself and your fellow riders is also examined. WHY THIS INFORMATION \\nIS IMPORTANT\\nAlcohol is a major contributor to \\nmotorcycle crashes, particularly fatal \\ncrashes. Studies show that nearly a third \\nof all fatally injured motorcycle riders \\nhad BAC levels above the legal limit of \\n0.08%. An additional 8% had lower \\nalcohol levels (BAC 0.01 to 0.07%), \\ndemonstrating that having only a drink \\nor two in one’s system is enough to \\nimpair riding skills. Drug involvement \\nis harder to distinguish and may have \\nbeen separated from drinking violations \\nfor the traffic records. But riding “under \\nthe influence” of either alcohol or \\ndrugs poses physical hazards and legal \\nconsequences for every rider. Drinking and drug use is as big a \\nproblem among motorcyclists as it is \\namong automobile drivers. Motorcyclists, \\nhowever, are more likely to be killed or \\nseverely injured in a crash. Injuries occur \\nin 90% of motorcycle crashes and 33% \\nof automobile crashes that involve abuse \\nof substances. By becoming knowledgeable about \\nthe effects of alcohol and drugs you will \\nsee that riding and impairment don’t mix. Take positive steps to protect yourself \\nand prevent others from harming \\nthemselves. ALCOHOL AND DRUGS IN \\nMOTORCYCLE OPERATION\\nNo one is immune to the effects \\nof alcohol or drugs. Friends may brag \\nabout their ability to hold their liquor \\nor perform better on drugs, but alcohol \\nor drugs make them less able to think \\nclearly and perform physical tasks \\nskillfully. Judgment and the decision-\\nmaking processes needed for vehicle \\noperation are affected long before legal \\nlimits are reached. Many over-the-counter, prescription \\nand illegal drugs have side effects that \\nincrease the risk of riding. It is difficult to \\naccurately measure the involvement of \\nparticular drugs in motorcycle crashes. But we do know what the effects of \\nvarious drugs have on the processes \\ninvolved in riding a motorcycle. We \\nalso know that the combined effects of \\nalcohol and drugs are more dangerous \\nthan either is alone. ALCOHOL IN THE BODY\\nAlcohol enters the bloodstream \\nquickly. Unlike most foods and \\nbeverages, it does not need to be \\ndigested. Within minutes after being \\nconsumed, it reaches the brain and \\nbegins to affect the drinker. The major \\neffect alcohol has is to slow down and \\nimpair bodily functions — both mental \\nand physical. Whatever activity you do, \\nyou do less well after consuming alcohol. Blood Alcohol Concentration\\nBlood Alcohol Concentration or BAC \\nis the amount of alcohol in relation to \\nblood in the body. Generally, alcohol can \\nbe eliminated in the body at the rate of \\nalmost one drink per hour. But a variety \\nof factors may also influence the level \\n\\n\\x08\\n41\\n\\t\\n41\\nof alcohol retained. The more alcohol in \\nyour blood, the greater the degree of \\nimpairment. Three primary factors play a major part \\nin determining BAC:\\n•\\t The amount\\x03 of alcohol you consume. •\\t How fast\\x03 you drink. •\\t Your body\\x03 weight. Other factors also contribute to the \\nway alcohol affects your system. Your sex, physical condition and food \\nintake are just a few that may cause your \\nBAC level to be even higher. But the \\nfull effects of these are not fully known. Alcohol may still accumulate in your \\nbody even if you are drinking at a \\nrate of one drink per hour, especially \\nfor women. Abilities and judgment can \\nbe affected by that one drink. A 12-ounce can of beer, a mixed drink \\nwith one shot (1.5 ounces) of hard liquor, \\nand a 5-ounce glass of wine all contain \\nthe same amount of alcohol. The faster you drink, the more alcohol \\naccumulates in your body. If you drink \\ntwo drinks in an hour, at the end of that \\nhour, at least one drink will remain in \\nyour bloodstream. Without taking into account any \\nother factors, these examples illustrate \\nwhy time is a critical factor when a rider \\ndecides to drink. If you drink:\\n– Seven drinks over the span of three \\nhours you would have at least four (7 – \\n3 = 4) drinks remaining in your system \\nat the end of the three hours. You \\nwould need at least another four hours \\nto eliminate the alcohol from the four \\nremaining drinks before you consider \\nriding. – Four drinks over the span of two \\nhours, you would have at least two \\n(4 – 2 = 2) drinks remaining in your \\nsystem at the end of the two hours. You \\nwould need at least another two hours \\nto eliminate the alcohol from the two \\nremaining drinks before you consider \\nriding. ALCOHOL AND THE LAW\\nIn all but one state, an adult with a \\nBAC of 0.08% or above is considered \\nintoxicated (in Utah the threshold is \\n0.05%). For operators under the age of \\n21, lower BAC limits (0.00 to 0.02%, \\ndepending on state) apply. It doesn’t \\nmatter how sober you may look or act. A \\nbreath, blood, or urine test is what usually \\nALCOHOL CONTENT\\n\\n42\\x08\\nBEING IN SHAPE TO RIDE\\ndetermines whether you are riding legally \\nor illegally. Whether or not you are legally \\nintoxicated is not the real issue. Impairment of judgment and skills begins \\nwell below the legal limit. Consequences of Conviction\\nYears ago, first offenders had a good \\nchance of getting off with a small fine \\nand participation in alcohol-abuse classes. Today the laws of most states impose \\nstiff penalties on drinking operators. And \\nthose penalties are mandatory, meaning \\nthat judges must impose them. If you are convicted of riding under the \\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs, you may \\nreceive any of the following penalties:\\n\\uf06e\\tLicense Suspension\\x03 — Mandatory \\nsuspension for conviction, arrest or \\nrefusal to submit to a breath test. \\uf06e\\tFines\\x03 — Severe fines are another \\naspect of a conviction, usually levied \\nwith a license suspension. \\uf06e\\tInsurance Rate Increase\\x03 — A DUI/\\nDWI conviction can put you into a \\n“high risk” category. So, having a DUI \\non your driving record means you’ll be \\npaying for it long after your court or \\nlegal interactions have ended. \\uf06e\\tCommunity Service\\x03 — Performing \\ntasks such as picking up litter along \\nthe highway, washing cars in the \\nmotor-vehicle pool or working at an \\nemergency ward. \\uf06e\\tCosts \\x03— Additional lawyer’s fees, \\nlost work time spent in court or \\nalcohol-education programs, public \\ntransportation costs (while your \\nlicense is suspended), and the added \\npsychological costs of being known as \\na “drunk driver.”\\nMINIMIZE THE RISKS\\nYour ability to judge how well you are \\nriding is affected first. Although you may \\nbe performing more and more poorly, \\nyou think you are doing better and better. The result is that you ride confidently, \\ntaking greater and greater risks. Minimize \\nthe risks of drinking and riding by taking \\nsteps before you drink or choose to totally \\nseparate the two. Separate your drinking \\nfrom your riding. Make an Intelligent Choice\\nDon’t Drink — Once you start, your \\nresistance is weaker. Setting a limit or pacing yourself are \\npoor alternatives at best. Your ability to \\nuse good judgment is one of the first \\nthings affected by alcohol. Even if you \\nhave tried to drink in moderation, you \\nmay not realize to what extent your skills \\nhave suffered from alcohol’s impairing \\neffects. Or Don’t Ride — If you haven’t \\ncontrolled your drinking, you must avoid \\nriding. \\uf06e\\tLeave the motorcycle\\x03 — so you \\nwon’t be tempted to ride. Arrange \\nanother way to get home. \\uf06e\\tWait\\x03 — If you exceed your limit, wait \\nuntil your system eliminates the alcohol \\nand its fatiguing after-effects. STEP IN TO PROTECT A \\nFRIEND\\nPeople who have had too much to \\ndrink are unable to make a responsible \\ndecision. It is up to others to step in \\nand keep them from taking too great \\na risk. No one likes doing this — it’s \\nuncomfortable and embarrassing. And \\nyou are rarely thanked for your efforts at \\nthe time.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\motorcycle-operator-manual.pdf'}, page_content='But the alternatives are often \\nworse. There are several ways to keep friends \\nfrom hurting themselves:\\n\\uf06e\\tArrange a safe ride\\x03 — Provide \\nalternative ways for them to get home. \\x08\\n43\\n\\uf06e\\tSlow the pace of drinking\\x03 — Involve \\nthem in other activities. \\uf06e\\tKeep them there\\x03 — Use any excuse \\nto keep them from getting on their \\nmotorcycle.

CANNABIS & MOTOR-\\nCYCLE OPERATION\\nCannibis (Marijuana) is gaining \\nacceptance as having legitimate medicinal \\napplications and as a recreational drug in \\nthe United States, as evidenced by recent \\ntrends in state laws permitting its use. More than half the states allow cannabis \\nfor medical use, and some allow it for \\nrecreational use by people 21 and over. Although cannabis may be legal for \\nmedicinal or recreational use in your \\nstate, it is still not legal, safe, or wise to \\noperate a motor vehicle while impaired \\nby cannabis, since it tends to distort your \\nperception of time, space and speed. This \\nis especially critical for motorcycle riders, \\nwho must continually make detailed \\nassessments of complex traffic situations \\nand make split-second decisions requiring \\nprecise rider input to navigate safely and \\nmaintain an adequate safety margin. When cannabis is smoked, its effects \\ngenerally begin within a few minutes \\nand can last from 2 to 4 hours. But when \\ncannabis is eaten, the onset of effects \\ncould be delayed for more than an hour \\nand the duration of the “high” could be \\nmore than 6 hours. Be safe. Do not operate your \\nmotorcycle or any motor vehicle if you are \\nimpaired by cannabis, and find alternate \\ntransportation if you are planning to be \\nunder the influence of cannabis at your \\ndestination. Just as with alcohol, riders \\nimpaired by cannabis can be convicted \\nof riding under the influence, and be \\nsubjected to similar harsh penalties.

Crashes are fairly common among \\nbeginning operators, especially in \\nthe first months of riding. Operating \\nMOTORCYCLE \\nAND THREE-WHEEL \\nMOTORCYCLE DESIGNS\\nan unfamiliar motorcycle adds to the \\nproblem. If you borrow a three-wheel \\nmotorcycle or motorcycle with sidecar, \\nget familiar with it in a controlled area \\nfirst. If you lend your three-wheel \\nmotorcycle or motorcycle with sidecar \\nto friends, make sure they are licensed \\nand know how to ride before you \\nallow them to operate in traffic. Such \\nmotorcycles operate very differently \\nthan two-wheel motorcycles. No matter how experienced you may \\nbe, be extra careful on any vehicle that \\nis unfamiliar or new to you. Get Familiar with \\nMotorcycle Controls\\nBe sure you are familiar with the \\ncontrols of the three-wheel motorcycle \\nor motorcycle with a sidecar before \\nattempting to operate it on any \\nhighway, since some controls may differ \\nfrom those found on other motorcycles. This is especially important if you are \\nriding on a borrowed motorcycle. Before \\nbeginning the ride:\\n\\uf06e\\tMake all the checks\\x03 you would on \\nyour own motorcycle. \\uf06e\\tFamiliarize yourself with all \\ncontrols, such as the turn signals, \\nhorn, headlight switch, fuel control \\nvalve, and cut-off switch.

Know the gearshift \\npattern and operate the throttle, \\nclutch and brakes a few times. Controls react differently on different \\nmotorcycles, and exact locations \\nof controls may vary slightly. Additionally, some motorcycle \\nconversions may be equipped with \\na single brake pedal or lever control, \\nautomatic clutch, or automatic \\n\\n48\\x08\\nTHREE-WHEEL SUPPLEMENT\\ntransmission. \\uf06e\\tAs you begin to ride, start out slowly \\nand carefully and be aware of your \\nsurroundings. Accelerate gently, take \\nturns slowly, and leave extra room for \\nstopping. BASIC VEHICLE CONTROL\\nSteering & Tip\\nThree-wheel motorcycles handle \\ndifferently than two-wheel motorcycles. With three wheels on the ground, \\nthey are naturally more stable than a \\ntwo-wheel motorcycle. They also steer \\ndifferently. Because conventional three-\\nwheel motorcycles cannot lean, they \\ncannot countersteer. Instead, the front \\nwheel is pointed in the direction the \\nrider wants the motorcycle to go. Under some conditions during the \\noperation of a three-wheel motorcycle, \\nit is possible to have only two wheels \\nin contact with the road surface. This \\ncould occur during turning or tight \\nmaneuvers whenever enough weight is \\ntransferred outside of what are called \\ntip-over lines.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\motorcycle-operator-manual.pdf'}, page_content='This tendency requires \\ncareful load and passenger positioning \\ninside the tip-over lines to help maintain \\nmaximum stability. Body Position\\nAs with any motor vehicle, operator \\nposition is important for control and \\nfor reducing or preventing fatigue. The \\noperator should be able to reach both \\nhandgrips comfortably, since more \\nhandlebar movement is necessary than \\nwhen riding a two-wheel motorcycle. While it is not necessary for the rider \\nof a three-wheel motorcycle to move \\ndrastically during operation, shifting \\nweight in the direction of the turn can \\nimprove control. Braking\\nOn a motorcycle with a sidecar, \\nduring braking in a sharp turn, the \\nsidecar wheel may lift off the ground. Motorcycle and sidecar tires have limited \\ntraction or grip on the road surface, and \\ntraction is greater when the motorcycle \\nis rolling, not skidding or slipping. During turning, some of the available \\ntire traction is used for cornering, so less \\nis available for stopping. Thus, a skid \\ncan occur if you brake too hard. Turning\\nThe tendency of the rear inside \\nwheel to lift during turning is greater \\nwith increased speed and tighter curve \\nradii. During a turn, inertia causes the \\ncenter of gravity of the motorcycle to \\nshift sideways and outward toward the \\ntip-over line. The reduced weight over \\nthe opposite side wheel can cause it to \\nlift slightly. The weight of a three-track \\nmotorcycle is distributed almost equally \\nbetween the two front or two rear \\nwheels. These motorcycles generally \\nhandle the same in left and right hand \\nturns. When turning a three-track \\nmotorcycle:\\n\\uf06e\\tApproach a turn at speed with your \\nTIP-OVER LINES\\n\\nTHREE-WHEEL SUPPLEMENT\\x08\\n49\\nhead up, and look through the turn. \\uf06e\\tConcentrate on pointing the front \\nwheel/wheels in the direction you \\nwant the motorcycle to go. \\uf06e\\tRoll off the throttle before entering \\nthe turn. \\uf06e\\tApply the brakes enough to slow \\nthe motorcycle to a speed at which \\nyou can ride safely through the turn, \\nthen release the brakes before the \\nturn. \\uf06e\\tSlightly lean your upper body in the \\ndirection you intend to turn. \\uf06e\\tSteer the front wheel/wheels toward \\nthe turn. \\uf06e\\tRoll on the throttle slightly for \\nstability. On the other hand, because the \\ncenter of gravity of a motorcycle with \\nsidecar is close to the motorcycle itself, \\nthe behavior of the vehicle when \\nturning right and when turning left is \\nquite different. During a right turn, a slight sideways \\nmovement of the center of gravity \\ncreates a greater tendency for the \\nsidecar wheel to lift. The lift will be \\ngreater if the sidecar is empty or lightly \\nloaded. When turning right on a \\nmotorcycle with sidecar:\\n\\uf06e\\tAnticipate the degree of turn \\nrequired. \\uf06e\\tReduce speed before entering the \\ncurve by downshifting or braking. \\uf06e\\tSlightly lean your upper body in the \\ndirection you intend to turn. \\uf06e\\tMaintain speed as you enter the \\ncurve. \\uf06e\\tAccelerate gradually as you exit the \\ncurve. During a left hand turn, the sidecar \\nacts as a stabilizer, so the sidecar wheel \\nstays on the ground. However, if the \\nturn is taken too sharply or at too high \\na rate of speed, there is a tendency \\nfor the motorcycle rear suspension to \\nextend, and this may cause the rear \\nwheel of the motorcycle to lift off the \\nground. When turning left on a motorcycle \\nwith sidecar:\\n\\uf06e\\tReduce speed prior to entering the \\nturn \\n\\uf06e\\tApply more pressure on the rear \\nbrake than on the front\\nHills\\nWhen riding uphill on a three-wheel \\nmotorcycle or motorcycle with a sidecar, \\nsome weight will shift to the rear, \\ncausing the front of the motorcycle \\nto become lighter. This weight shift \\nreduces the traction on the front tire/\\ntires for steering and tire grip. When riding downhill, gravity \\nincreases the amount of braking force \\nrequired to slow or stop the motorcycle. It is important, therefore, to begin \\nslowing earlier for cornering and \\nstopping. Lane Position\\nThe track of the dual wheels of a \\nthree-wheel motorcycle or motorcycle \\nwith a sidecar is almost the same \\nwidth as some automobiles. Unlike a \\nmotorcycle, you are limited, therefore, in \\nlane positioning. Keep toward the center \\nof the lane to be sure the track of the \\ndual wheels does not cross the painted \\nlines into opposing traffic. Riding too far \\nto the right could cause loss of traction if \\nthe tire leaves the pavement. Lane positioning when riding \\nin groups is also an important \\nconsideration. You will not be able to \\n\\n50\\x08\\nTHREE-WHEEL SUPPLEMENT\\nuse a staggered formation, such as \\nyou would when riding two-wheeled \\nmotorcycles. Ride single file and always \\nmaintain a safe margin, two seconds \\nminimum, between vehicles. Parking at the Roadside \\nBecause of the limitations on mobility \\nand motorcycle length, it is not practical \\nto park your motorcycle at a 90° angle \\nwith your rear wheel touching the \\ncurb, as you would with a two-wheel \\nmotorcycle. Position your motorcycle in a \\nparking space so you are parked parallel \\nto the curb and set the parking brake. Some three-wheel motorcycles have \\nreverse, so you can more easily maneuver \\ninto a parking space designed for an \\nautomobile. Parking parallel to the curb \\nwill facilitate pulling away from the curb \\nand entering the lanes of traffic. Acceleration and Deceleration\\nA three-wheel motorcycle with two \\ndrive wheels tends to be much more \\nstable during acceleration and braking \\nthan a motorcycle with a sidecar. Attaching a sidecar to your motorcycle \\nadds a non-powered, off-centered mass \\nof weight. So, during acceleration, \\nthe sidecar will feel as though it is \\nlagging behind you, causing the vehicle \\nto feel as though it is being steered \\nto the right. During deceleration or \\nbraking, the momentum of the sidecar \\ncontinues to carry it forward, giving \\nthe feeling that the sidecar is trying to \\npass you, making the motorcycle feel as \\nthough it is being steered left. \\uf06e\\tOn acceleration, compensate for \\nthis tendency by steering slightly \\nin the opposite direction from the \\nsidecar. \\uf06e\\tOn deceleration, compensate for \\nthis tendency by steering slightly in \\nthe direction of the sidecar. You can \\nalso squeeze the clutch lever when \\nbraking. Swerving\\nA quick stop may not always be \\nsufficient to avoid an obstacle in your \\npath, even if you properly apply both \\nbrakes. Sometimes the only way to \\navoid a collision is to swerve. A swerve \\nis any sudden change of direction. It can \\nbe two quick turns or a rapid shift to the \\nside when maneuvering the motorcycle. Often, there is not much time to adjust \\nyour body position. A three-wheel motorcycle or \\nmotorcycle with sidecar is not as \\nmaneuverable as a two-wheel \\nmotorcycle, so plan well ahead to \\navoid the need for any sudden turns or \\nswerving. If braking is required, brake \\neither before or after the swerve, never \\nwhile swerving. Cornering & Curves\\nThe cornering characteristics of a \\nthree-wheel motorcycle or motorcycle \\nwith a sidecar differ from those of a \\nmotorcycle. Even with three wheels on \\nthe ground, a sidecar can tip over if it is \\nbeing turned too sharply or is going too \\nfast for a corner. Therefore, it is best to \\nalways slow before entering a corner. The best path to follow in the curve \\nmay not be the one that follows the \\ncurve of the road. Check opposing traffic \\ncarefully, and if safe, enter the curve \\ntoward the outside of your lane. This \\nincreases your line of sight through the \\ncurve and reduces the effective radius \\nof the curve. As you turn, move toward \\nthe inside of the curve, and as you pass \\nthe center, move to the outside to exit, \\nalways remembering to stay in your lane. THREE-WHEEL SUPPLEMENT\\x08\\n51\\nCARRYING PASSENGERS \\nAND CARGO\\nThree-wheel motorcycles are designed \\nto carry passengers and cargo, but \\ndo not exceed the tire or motorcycle \\nloading capacity. The extra weight could \\nchange the handling characteristics of \\nthe vehicle slightly, so you must give \\nsome thought to where the loads are \\npositioned. Many three-track motorcycles will have \\nbuilt-in storage compartments for cargo, \\neither in front of, or behind the rider. On these motorcycles, center the load \\nand keep it low in the storage areas so \\nit is positioned within the tip-over lines \\nand balanced side-to-side. If a passenger \\nis being carried, the passenger will sit \\ndirectly behind the rider. On a motorcycle with a sidecar, the \\nbest place for a passenger is in the \\nsidecar. Never put a single passenger \\non the saddle; the added weight on the \\ntip-over-line will increase the instability \\nof the motorcycle. While a second \\npassenger can be carried on the seat \\nbehind the rider, the heavier passenger \\nshould always be in the sidecar. When carrying loads in a sidecar, \\nsecure the load firmly in place, since \\nif the load shifts, handling will be \\naffected. Loads should be distributed \\ntoward the rear of the sidecar to reduce \\ntipping of the nose of the sidecar in the \\nevent of a sudden left turn. When loaded, you may find \\nperformance is reduced and that stopping \\ndistances are longer, so allow some \\nextra distance. The addition of a sidecar \\npassenger will greatly improve stability, \\nand right hand turns can be made at \\na slightly higher speed. Turning left, \\nhowever, will require more turning force.
